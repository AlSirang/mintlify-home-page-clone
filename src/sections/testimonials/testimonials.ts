The team helped us set up two different websites and even migrated all the content for us. I can't recommend it enough.`,

Now the docs are managed as code and are part of the dev process and PR. As an open source project - moving the docs to the repo (with zero effort) also enabled our community to help us maintain and fix problems as contributors. Our devs and our users love it.`,
